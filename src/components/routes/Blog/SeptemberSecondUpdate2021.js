            September Patch amidst our Busy Schedule
          </Heading>
          <Description>
            Now, the Lead Dev is busy, so I am writing the blog posts, at least for now. Anyways, Ashwin here.
            Android 12 is right around the corner, we thought this would be the last Android 11 update, but it
            seems it would take a month more for the sources to release, so there might aswell be an Android 11 October
            update. Shen recently got his new Poco X3 Pro, so this would be the final update for his previous
            device X00TD (sad to see that go). About this update, we have merged upstream from Lineage OS and
            because Shen is busy with his work, this update will be short and sweet.

            Now, the changelogs for this release of Project Sakura are,
            <Suspense fallback={renderLoader()}>
              <AdComponent />
            </Suspense>

          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              Fixed SafetyNet failing for most users
            </ListItem>
            <br />
            <ListItem>
              Redesigned QS Media player

            <br />
            <ListItem>

            So, this was the small update and we will (hopefully) see you again with another update, as much as we are excited about the Android 12, it might be hard for Shen
            to juggle all the things in his life, anyways we hope you don't end up with bugs but you can always
            avoid them by by wearing a Project Sakura exclusive Tshirt which you can check
